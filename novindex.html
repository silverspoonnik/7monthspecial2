    <p>NOVEMBER, FOR ME NOVEMBER WILL BE THE MONTH OF LOVE. ITS ALL BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I GATHERED THE COURAGE TO PROPOSE SOMEONE. THIS 
        MONTH IS SPECIAL BECAUSE I FELT I EXPERIENCED SO MANY NEW THINGS IN THIS MONTH, I TRIED FOR YOU, PLAYING BADMINTON , TRYING TO SNEAK INTO YOUR
        GROUPS, AND NOT MISSING ANY OPPORTUNITIES, FROM MOMOS TO KAJU KATLI I REMEMBER I USED TO KEEP TRYING TO GET CLOSER TO YOU, UNTIL 27TH NOVEMBER, WHERE
        I WENT WAY BEYOND MY ANXIETY TO PROPOSE YOU, AND BY GODS BLESSINGS HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE. I LOVE YOU MY AASHU, THANK YOU.
