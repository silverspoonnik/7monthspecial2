    <p>the audacity of you to say kaamwali bai in this look is not at all acceptable Aashu. I still remember how your looks in saree always killed me.
        i want to see you in saree more often. Also thank u for ur gift on my birthday , the teddy bear birthday card is still safe with me in my heart
        and i just want to tell you , you look so freaking beuatiful and i am blessed to have you by my side.I told you in the video , i keep telling you often
        and i am even telling you now.... you are too beautiful Aashu and i am blessed to have you as my girlfriend. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
