        <div id="letter"><p>MY DEAR AASHU,</p>
        <p>Every moment that i have ever spent with you has been memorable for me.I never thought god would bless me with a girlfriend
            so good looking, so caring , that i would never have to worry about anything. The smile on your face makes my day Aashu.You have hypnotized
        me with your beauty Aashu,your words,your dance,your smile,your beauty,your nature , your literally everything has taken me to  a different world.
    Your happiness is all i want to see cutu. I will always love u like i do because losing u will be the loss i will never ask god for.
I just want whole of AASHNA ROSELINE BARA to be mine.I still remember those days when i used to come and play badminton with gundi only for a chance to make
a conversation with you,but these boys were always in my way,until i could talk to you , and chosing to propose u on this day was the best decision 
of my life.I know we both did not want this long distance phase to be in our life.I still remember how i was with you till the last until Uncle came to 
pick you up, and even though i had geared up myself for spending the 72 days online with you,i realized it in the hostel itself that leaving away from you
will come at a cost i was not ready to pay. Missing those morning walks,those happy moments together,missing ur sleep on my lap,missing ur neck,missing ur small kisses,
missing the feeling of feeding u with my own eyes, missing the feeling of taking care of you,it would have been so hard had we not been able to communicate
in this vacation,but all thanks to god that now only 25 days are left before i meet u and hug u and kiss u hard.Thank you for being in my life,thank you for making me happy,thank you for bringing a shine in my life,a spark in my life. I hope i always treat
you well.I hope i never hurt you. My Aashu,my baby,my cutie,my kittu,my mishti doi,my everything,my life, please always be with me like this forever.
Thank you so much and happy 7 months anniversary my angel,my Aashu.I love you so so so so so so so much. </p>
