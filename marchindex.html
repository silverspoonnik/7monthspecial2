    <p>you know the song gulabi sadi ki ek line thhi..... <br>AE NAKHREWALI , KUTHE NIGHALI, GHALUN SADI , LAAL GULABI <br>
        well these lines were literally made for you. Look at my nakhrewali Aashu not showing her face even though she looks so pretty.
        But seriously i am ready to lift ur nakhres and tempers all my life. I love you and i love having fun with u like this Aashu. I still remember
        how happy i was in march end when i got to know that I will drop you to the station but i was equally sad that i couldnt be with you and i was laving you.
        it was sad, but it made me love you so much.
